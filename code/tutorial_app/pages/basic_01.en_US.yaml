welcome_msg: |
  ##### A project is a Git repository with some metadata files that give Workbench information to:
  - Version the development environment, including code, software and data
  - Build, manage and run the container
  - Configure, start and stop applications installed in the container
  - Reserve and mount GPUs into the container
  - Create and manage mounts and volumes for the container

  ##### This exercise will show you the basics of the Project Tab:
  - How to use the File Browser
  - How to manage packages
  - How to reserve GPUs
  - How to discard changes



tasks:
  - name: Project Tab > Project Dashboard 
    msg: |
      ![dashboard](app/static/basic_01/dashboard.png)
      ##### The Project Dashboard is an overview of the project with three sections.
      - **Get Started** How to get going
      - **Environment**: What's in it and what's currently running
      - **Resources**: GPU status and local disk storage for the project

      ###### Go to **Project Dashboard > Environment > Project Container** to see that this Tutorial App is `RUNNING`.


  - name: Project Tab > File Browser > Create Folder
    msg: |  
      ##### The Project Tab has a file browser to access, manage and edit files. 
      
      * Click **File Browser** in the LHS menu.
      * Click **Create Folder**, and name it `my-first-folder`.

    response: |
      ##### Great. You just created a folder in the project. 
      
      > **Note:** Normally you would have to do this through the command line, but Workbench provides a GUI for it.

    test: check_folder_exists

  - name: File Browser > Drag and Drop
    msg: |  
      ##### You can add files to the project directly through the File Browser.
      * Click `my-first-folder`
      * Drag and drop a file into the folder

    response: |
      ##### Awesome. You just added a file to the project.
      
      > **Note:** On your local system, you could have done this in multiple ways without Workbench.     
      However, if the project were on a remote location, you would have had to transfer
      the file via something like `scp`, or you could have used JupyterLab's file browser to upload the files.

    test: check_file_in_folder


  - name: File Browser > Option Dots > Delete 
    msg: |
      ##### The Option Dots (three vertical dots) are a common UI pattern in Workbench. 

      For example, you can delete files in the the file browser through the option dots.

      * Click the :open_file_folder: icon in the breadcrumbs at the top left of the file browser to go back to the root folder.
      * Click the `code` folder in the top level of the project. You should see:
        * The `tutorial_app` folder. It has the code for this app.
        * The `example-file.txt` file.
        * The `delete-me.txt` file.      
      * Click the option dots on the RHS of the `delete-me.txt` file and select `Delete`.

    response: |
      ##### Great. You deleted the `delete-me.txt` file.

    test: check_file_deleted

  - name: File Browser > Option Dots > Edit
    msg: |
      ##### Files in the File Browser have actions besides Delete. 
      
      For example, **Edit** lets you view and edit a text file without a full editor. It's not a 
      full-featured editor, but it's good for small edits.

      * Click the option dots on the RHS of the `example-file.txt` file and select `Edit`.
      * A bare bones file editor will open. Add some text like `Hello, World!` and click **Save**.

    response: |
      ##### Nice. You edited the file. 

      > **Note:** Again, you can do this multiple ways locally, but if the file were a remote location you would
      need to open up JupyterLab or jump through some hoops in a terminal.

    test: check_file_changed

  - name: Environment > Project Container > Packages
    msg: |
      ##### Workbench lets you manage packages without using the command line. 

      * Click **Environment > Project Container**
      * Click **Packages** on the RHS to see installed packages. 
      * Click *Add* and select `apt`
      * Enter `jq` in the bar, click **Add** and then **Submit**

      > **Note:** Adding packages through the UI also makes sure they are *versioned*. 

    response: |
      ##### Nice. You added the package to the project. 

      > **Note:** If the package is still installing, you should see some messaging in the very bottom of the Project Tab in the status bar.

    test: add_ubuntu_package

  - name: Environment > Project Container > Hardware
    msg: |
      ##### Workbench manages the reservation and allocation of GPUs for the project. 

      It does this at a fairly deep level, but on a project by project basis the
      user experience is simple. 
      
      You just go to the appropriate section and indicate how many GPUs
      you want allocated to the project.
      
      
      * Go to **Environment > Project Container > Hardware**
      * The count should say **0**.
      * Change it to **1**.


    response: |
      ##### Nice. You now know how to reserve a GPU for the project. 

      > **Note:** You can't *actually* access a GPU with this project because it doesn't have CUDA installed. You
      also may not have a local GPU. 

    test: ensure_gpu_count

  - name: Git > Changes > Discard
    msg: |
      ##### Workbench uses Git to track changes and selectively discard them. 

      Streamlined Git version control is a primary feature of Workbench, and it 
      tracks the difference between the *current state* of a file and its *current version*.   

      Seeing these differences on a file-by-file basis helps you decide whether to commit changes or stick with the current version of a file.

      * Go to **Git > Changes** to see the changes you made in this exercise.
      * The left pane lists the files and the change type: `A` is *added*, `M` is *modified*, and `D` is *deleted*.
      * Clicking an individual file shows the line by line changes in the right pane.
      * You can resize the left and right panes by grabbing the divider between them and dragging it.

      The **Option Dots** on each file let you decide on a file-by-file basis.
      - **Discard changes** reverts the entire file to the versioned state.
      - **Add to .gitignore** adds the file to the `.gitignore` file so that it won't be tracked by Git in the future.

      Let's discard the changes all at once.

      * Click the **Option Dots** on the top row of the left pane.
      * Select **Discard changes**.

# TODO: fix the actual logic here because it's not actually checking the changes are discarded. A commit will pass this test.

    # response: | 
    #   OK. All tracked files are now back to how they were before you made any changes. The package you installed, the file you deleted, and the file you edited
    #   are all as they were before you touched them.

    #   > **Note:** The changes are gone **permanently** because they were not commited.
    
    test: check_changes_discarded

closing_msg: |
  ##### Ok. That was a lightning tour of the Project Tab. We didn't cover everything, but hopefully you got the idea.
